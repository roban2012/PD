<a href= "pic11.html">马斯洛需求层次理论(Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs)</a><br><br>

马斯洛需求层次理论是行为科学的理论之一，由美国心理学家亚伯拉罕・马斯洛在1943年在《人类激励理论》论文中所提出。书中将人类需求象阶梯一样从低到高按层次分为五种，分别是：生理需求、安全需求、社交需求、尊重需求和自我实现需求。<br><br>
马斯洛理论把需求分成生理需求（Physiological needs）、安全需求（Safety needs）、爱和归属感（Love and belonging）、尊重（Esteem）<br><br>

和自我实现（Self-actualization）五类，依次由较低层次到较高层次排列。在自我实现需求之后，还有自我超越需求（Self-Transcendence needs），但通常不作为马斯洛需求层次理论中必要的层次，大多数会将自我超越合并至自我实现需求当中。[4] 
通俗理解：假如一个人同时缺乏食物、安全、爱和尊重，通常对食物的需求量是最强烈的，其它需要则显得不那么重要。此时人的意识几乎全被饥饿所占据，所有能量都被用来获取食物。在这种极端情况下，人生的全部意义就是吃，其它什么都不重要。只有当人从生理需要的控制下解放出来时，才可能出现更高级的、社会化程度更高的需要如安全的需要。<br><br>

<a href= "pic14.html">Alfred Adler（与弗洛伊德并肩的心理学大师）</a><br><br>


一、生理需求应用<br><br>

生理需求（Physiological needs），也称级别最低、最具优势的需
<br><br>
求，如：食物、水、空气、性欲、健康。<br><br>
未满足生理需求的特征：什么都不想，只想让自己活下去，思考能力、道德观明显变得脆弱。例如：当一个人极需要食物时，会不择手段地抢夺食物。人民在战乱时，是不会排队领面包的。 假设人为报酬而工作，以生理需求来激励下属。
<br><br>
激励措施：增加工资、改善劳动条件、给予更多的业余时间和工间休息、提高福利待遇。[6] 
<br><br>
二、安全需求应用<br><br>

安全需求（Safety needs），同样属于低级别的需求，其中包括对人身安全、生活稳定以及免遭痛苦、威胁或疾病等。
<br><br>
缺乏安全感的特征：感到自己对身边的事物受到威胁，觉得这世界是不公平或是危险的。认为一切事物都是危险的、而变的紧张、彷徨不安、认为一切事物都是“恶”的。例如：一个孩子，在学校被同学欺负、受到老师不公平的对待，而开始变得不相信这社会，变得不敢表现自己、不敢拥有社交生活（因为他认为社交是危险的），而借此来保护自身安全。一个成人，工作不顺利，薪水微薄，养不起家人，而变的自暴自弃，每天利用喝酒，吸烟来寻找短暂的安逸感。<br><br>

激励措施：强调规章制度、职业保障、福利待遇，并保护员工不致失业，提供医疗保险、失业保险和退休福利、避免员工收到双重的指令而混乱。[6] <br><br>

三、社交需求应用<br><br>

社交需求（Love and belonging needs），属于较高层次的需求，如：对友谊、爱情以及隶属关系的需求。
<br><br>
缺乏社交需求的特征：因为没有感受到身边人的关怀，而认为自己没有价值活在这世界上。例如：一个没有受到父母关怀的青少年，认为自己在家庭中没有价值，所以在学校交朋友，无视道德观和理性地积极地寻找朋友或是同类。譬如说：青少年为了让自己融入社交圈中，帮别人做牛做马，甚至吸烟，恶作剧等。<br><br>

激励措施：提供同事间社交往来机会，支持与赞许员工寻找及建立和谐温馨的人际关系，开展有组织的体育比赛和集体聚会。[4] 
<br><br>
四、尊重需求应用<br><br>

尊重需求（Esteem needs），属于较高层次的需求，如：成就、名声、地位和晋升机会等。尊重需求既包括对成就或自我价值的个人感觉，也包括他人对自己的认可与尊重。<br><br>

无法满足尊重需求的特征：变的很爱面子，或是很积极地用行动来让别人认同自己，也很容易被虚荣所吸引。例如：利用暴力来证明自己的强悍、努力读书让自己成为医生、律师来证明自己在这社会的存在和价值、富豪为了自己名利而赚钱，或是捐款。
<br><br>
激励措施：公开奖励和表扬，强调工作任务的艰巨性以及成功所需要的高超技巧，颁发荣誉奖章、在公司刊物发表文章表扬、优秀员工光荣榜。[6] <br><br>

五、自我实现需求应用<br><br>

自我实现需求（Self-actualization），是最高层次的需求，包括针对于真善美至高人生境界获得的需求，因此前面四项需求都能满足，最高层次的需求方能相继产生，是一种衍生性需求，如：自我实现，发挥潜能等。
<br><br>
缺乏自我实现需求的特征：觉得自己的生活被空虚感给推动着，要自己去做一些身为一个“人”应该在这世上做的事，极需要有让他能更充实自己的事物、尤其是让一个人深刻的体验到自己没有白活在这世界上的事物。也开始认为，价值观、道德观胜过金钱、爱人、尊重和社会的偏见。例如：一个真心为了帮助他人而捐款的人。一位武术家、运动家把自己的体能练到极致，让自己成为世界一流或是单纯只为了超越自己。一位企业家，真心认为自己所经营的事业能为这社会带来价值，而为了比昨天更好而工作。
<br><br>
激励措施：设计工作时运用复杂情况的适应策略，给有特长的人委派特别任务，在设计工作和执行计划时为下级留有余地。[4] 
<br><br>
六、超自我实现应用
<br><br>
超自我实现（Over Actualization）是马斯洛在晚期时，所提出的一个理论。这是当一个人的心理状态充分的满足了自我实现的需求时，所出现短暂的“高峰经验”，通常都是在执行一件事情时，或是完成一件事情时，才能深刻体验到的这种感觉，通常都是出现在艺术家、或是音乐家身上。例如一位音乐家，在演奏音乐时，所感受到的一股“忘我”的体验。 一位艺术家在画图时，感受不到时间的消逝，他在画图的每一分钟，对他来说跟一秒一样快，但每一秒却活的比一个礼拜还充实。 [6] 
<br><br>
在马斯洛一生当中并没有提到超自我实现这一层次，只有自我超越需求（Self-Transcendence needs），而且经常被合并至自我实现需求层次中。超自我实现也许是传播和翻译过程中的失误。

<br><br>
Wahba, M. A.和Bridwell, L. G在1976年发表于《组织行为和人类表达》（Organizational Behavior and Human Performance）的文章《马斯洛反思：对需求层次理论的研究概述》（Maslow reconsidered: A review of research on the need hierarchy theory.）中表示马斯洛理论的需求排名，或者某些特定需求存在的证据并不足。

Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs is a theory in psychology proposed by Abraham Maslow in his 1943 paper "A Theory of Human Motivation" in Psychological Review.[2] Maslow subsequently extended the idea to include his observations of humans' innate curiosity. His theories parallel many other theories of human developmental psychology, some of which focus on describing the stages of growth in humans. Maslow used the terms "physiological", "safety", "belongingness" and "love", "esteem", "self-actualization" and "self-transcendence" to describe the pattern that human motivations generally move through.
<br><br>
Maslow studied what he called exemplary people such as Albert Einstein, Jane Addams, Eleanor Roosevelt, and Frederick Douglass rather than mentally ill or neurotic people, writing that "the study of crippled, stunted, immature, and unhealthy specimens can yield only a cripple psychology and a cripple philosophy."[3] Maslow studied the healthiest 1% of the college student population.[4]
<br><br>
Maslow's theory was fully expressed in his 1954 book Motivation and Personality.[5] The hierarchy remains a very popular framework in sociology research, management training[6] and secondary and higher psychology instruction.
<br><br>

Maslow's hierarchy of needs is often portrayed in the shape of a pyramid with the largest, most fundamental levels of needs at the bottom and the need for self-actualization at the top.[1][7] While the pyramid has become the de facto way to represent the hierarchy, Maslow himself never used a pyramid to describe these levels in any of his writings on the subject.
<br><br>
The most fundamental and basic four layers of the pyramid contain what Maslow called "deficiency needs" or "d-needs": esteem, friendship and love, security, and physical needs. If these "deficiency needs" are not met C with the exception of the most fundamental (physiological) need C there may not be a physical indication, but the individual will feel anxious and tense. Maslow's theory suggests that the most basic level of needs must be met before the individual will strongly desire (or focus motivation upon) the secondary or higher level needs. Maslow also coined the term "metamotivation" to describe the motivation of people who go beyond the scope of the basic needs and strive for constant betterment.[8]
<br><br>
The human mind and brain are complex and have parallel processes running at the same time, thus many different motivations from various levels of Maslow's hierarchy can occur at the same time. Maslow spoke clearly about these levels and their satisfaction in terms such as "relative," "general," and "primarily." Instead of stating that the individual focuses on a certain need at any given time, Maslow stated that a certain need "dominates" the human organism.[9] Thus Maslow acknowledged the likelihood that the different levels of motivation could occur at any time in the human mind, but he focused on identifying the basic types of motivation and the order in which they should be met.
<br><br>
Physiological needs
<br><br>
Physiological needs are the physical requirements for human survival. If these requirements are not met, the human body cannot function properly and will ultimately fail. Physiological needs are thought to be the most important; they should be met first.
<br><br>
Air, water, and food are metabolic requirements for survival in all animals, including humans. Clothing and shelter provide necessary protection from the elements. While maintaining an adequate birth rate shapes the intensity of the human sexual instinct, sexual competition may also shape said instinct.[2]
<br><br>
Safety needs
<br><br>
With their physical needs relatively satisfied, the individual's safety needs take precedence and dominate behavior. In the absence of physical safety C due to war, natural disaster, family violence, childhood abuse, etc. C people may (re-)experience post-traumatic stress disorder or transgenerational trauma. In the absence of economic safety C due to economic crisis and lack of work opportunities C these safety needs manifest themselves in ways such as a preference for job security, grievance procedures for protecting the individual from unilateral authority, savings accounts, insurance policies, reasonable disability accommodations, etc. This level is more likely to be found in children because they generally have a greater need to feel safe.
<br><br>
Safety and Security needs include:<br><br>
##Personal security<br><br>
##Financial security<br><br>
##Health and well-being<br><br>
##Safety net against accidents/illness and their adverse impacts
<br><br>
Love and belonging<br><br>

After physiological and safety needs are fulfilled, the third level of human needs is interpersonal and involves feelings of belongingness. This need is especially strong in childhood and can override the need for safety as witnessed in children who cling to abusive parents. Deficiencies within this level of Maslow's hierarchy C due to hospitalism, neglect, shunning, ostracism, etc. C can impact the individual's ability to form and maintain emotionally significant relationships in general, such as:<br><br>
##Friendship<br><br>
##Intimacy<br><br>
##Family<br><br>

According to Maslow, humans need to feel a sense of belonging and acceptance among their social groups, regardless whether these groups are large or small. For example, some large social groups may include clubs, co-workers, religious groups, professional organizations, sports teams, and gangs. Some examples of small social connections include family members, intimate partners, mentors, colleagues, and confidants. Humans need to love and be loved C both sexually and non-sexually C by others.[2] Many people become susceptible to loneliness, social anxiety, and clinical depression in the absence of this love or belonging element. This need for belonging may overcome the physiological and security needs, depending on the strength of the peer pressure.<br><br>

Esteem<br><br>

All humans have a need to feel respected; this includes the need to have self-esteem and self-respect. Esteem presents the typical human desire to be accepted and valued by others. People often engage in a profession or hobby to gain recognition. These activities give the person a sense of contribution or value. Low self-esteem or an inferiority complex may result from imbalances during this level in the hierarchy. People with low self-esteem often need respect from others; they may feel the need to seek fame or glory. However, fame or glory will not help the person to build their self-esteem until they accept who they are internally. Psychological imbalances such as depression can hinder the person from obtaining a higher level of self-esteem or self-respect.<br><br>

Most people have a need for stable self-respect and self-esteem. Maslow noted two versions of esteem needs: a "lower" version and a "higher" version. The "lower" version of esteem is the need for respect from others. This may include a need for status, recognition, fame, prestige, and attention. The "higher" version manifests itself as the need for self-respect. For example, the person may have a need for strength, competence, mastery, self-confidence, independence, and freedom. This "higher" version takes precedence over the "lower" version because it relies on an inner competence established through experience. Deprivation of these needs may lead to an inferiority complex, weakness, and helplessness.
<br><br>
Maslow states that while he originally thought the needs of humans had strict guidelines, the "hierarchies are interrelated rather than sharply separated".[5] This means that esteem and the subsequent levels are not strictly separated; instead, the levels are closely related.<br><br>

Self-actualization<br><br>

Main article: Self-actualization<br><br>

"What a man can be, he must be."[10] This quotation forms the basis of the perceived need for self-actualization. This level of need refers to what a person's full potential is and the realization of that potential. Maslow describes this level as the desire to accomplish everything that one can, to become the most that one can be.[11] Individuals may perceive or focus on this need very specifically. For example, one individual may have the strong desire to become an ideal parent. In another, the desire may be expressed athletically. For others, it may be expressed in paintings, pictures, or inventions.[12] As previously mentioned, Maslow believed that to understand this level of need, the person must not only achieve the previous needs, but master them.<br><br>

Self-transcendence
<br><br>
In his later years, Maslow explored a further dimension of needs, while criticizing his own vision on self-actualization.[13] The self only finds its actualization in giving itself to some higher goal outside oneself, in altruism and spirituality.<br><br>
Criticism
<br><br>
In their extensive review of research based on Maslow's theory, Wahba and Bridwell found little evidence for the ranking of needs that Maslow described or for the existence of a definite hierarchy at all.[19]
<br><br>
The order in which the hierarchy is arranged (with self-actualization described as the highest need) has been criticized as being ethnocentric by Geert Hofstede.[20] Maslow's hierarchy of needs fails to illustrate and expand upon the difference between the social and intellectual needs of those raised in individualistic societies and those raised in collectivist societies. The needs and drives of those in individualistic societies tend to be more self-centered than those in collectivist societies, focusing on improvement of the self, with self-actualization being the apex of self-improvement. In collectivist societies, the needs of acceptance and community will outweigh the needs for freedom and individuality.[21]
<br><br>
The term "Self-actualization" may not universally convey Maslow's observations; this motivation refers to focusing on becoming the best person that one can possibly strive for in the service of both the self and others.[9] Maslow's term of self-actualization might not properly portray the full extent of this level; quite often, when a person is at the level of self-actualization, much of what they accomplish in general may benefit others or, "the greater self".
<br><br>
The position and value of sex on the pyramid has also been a source of criticism regarding Maslow's hierarchy. Maslow's hierarchy places sex in the physiological needs category along with food and breathing; it lists sex solely from an individualistic perspective. For example, sex is placed with other physiological needs which must be satisfied before a person considers "higher" levels of motivation. Some critics feel this placement of sex neglects the emotional, familial, and evolutionary implications of sex within the community, although others point out that this is true of all of the basic needs.[22][23]
<br><br>
Changes to the hierarchy by circumstance
<br><br>
The higher-order (self-esteem and self-actualization) and lower-order (physiological, safety, and love) needs classification of Maslow's hierarchy of needs is not universal and may vary across cultures due to individual differences and availability of resources in the region or geopolitical entity/country.
<br><br>
In one study, exploratory factor analysis (EFA) of a thirteen item scale showed there were two particularly important levels of needs in the US during the peacetime of 1993 to 1994: survival (physiological and safety) and psychological (love, self-esteem, and self-actualization). In 1991, a retrospective peacetime measure was established and collected during the Persian Gulf War and US citizens were asked to recall the importance of needs from the previous year. Once again, only two levels of needs were identified; therefore, people have the ability and competence to recall and estimate the importance of needs. For citizens in the Middle East (Egypt and Saudi Arabia), three levels of needs regarding importance and satisfaction surfaced during the 1990 retrospective peacetime. These three levels were completely different from those of the US citizens.
<br><br>
Changes regarding the importance and satisfaction of needs from the retrospective peacetime to the wartime due to stress varied significantly across cultures (the US vs. the Middle East). For the US citizens, there was only one level of needs since all needs were considered equally important. With regards to satisfaction of needs during the war, in the US there were three levels: physiological needs, safety needs, and psychological needs (social, self-esteem, and self-actualization). During the war, the satisfaction of physiological needs and safety needs were separated into two independent needs while during peacetime, they were combined as one. For the people of the Middle East, the satisfaction of needs changed from three levels to two during wartime.[24][25][26]
<br><br>
A 1981 study looked at how Maslow's hierarchy might vary across age groups.[27] A survey asked participants of varying ages to rate a set number of statements from most important to least important. The researchers found that children had higher physical need scores than the other groups, the love need emerged from childhood to young adulthood, the esteem need was highest among the adolescent group, young adults had the highest self-actualization level, and while old age had the highest level of security, it was needed across all levels comparably. The authors argued that this suggested Maslow's hierarchy may be limited as a theory for developmental sequence since the sequence of the love need and the self-esteem need should be reversed according to age.
