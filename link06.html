Alfred Adler 是与 Sigmund Freud 并肩的心理学大师），是用心理分析方法研究家庭与儿童教育问题的创始人。Alfred Adler 被认为是西方教育心理学的主要领导人物之一。<br><br>
Alfred Adler：Founder of the school of Individual Psychology（个体心理学派创始人）<br><br>

“正面管教（Positive Discipline）”体系三十年前源于美国，以奥地利心理学家Alfred Adler和Rudolf Dreikurs的“个体心理学”理论为基础，由Jane Nelsen、Lynn Lott等教育专家组成的团队完善，发展为一个涵盖沟通和相互尊重的，体验式的家长教育课程、“正面管教”已成为美国主流家长教育体系之一。<br><br>

Alfred W. Adler (1870 C1937) was an Austrian medical doctor, psychotherapist, and founder of the school of individual psychology. His emphasis on the importance of feelings of inferiority―the inferiority complex―is recognized as isolating an element which plays a key role in personality development. Alfred Adler considered human beings as an individual whole, therefore he called his psychology "Individual Psychology" (Orgler 1976).<br><br>

Adler was the first to emphasize the importance of the social element in the re-adjustment process of the individual and who carried psychiatry into the community.<br><br>
阿尔弗雷德・阿德勒（Alfred Adler ，1870年-1937年），奥地利精神病学家。个体心理学的创始人，人本主义心理学先驱，现代自我心理学之父。弗洛伊德的学生之一，但也是精神分析学派内部第一个反对弗洛伊德的心理学体系的心理学家。<br><br>

阿德勒有《神经病的形成》、《自卑感》等著作，他将精神分析由生物学定向的本我转向社会文化定向的自我心理学，对后来西方心理学的发展具有重要意义。<br><br>

1895年阿德勒获得维也纳大学医学院博士学位，当眼科与内科医生。<br><br>

1899年阿德勒遇见精神病理学权威弗洛伊德（Sigmund Freud，1856―1939年），并跟随弗洛伊德学习。<br><br>

1902 年他参加弗洛伊德周三讨论会，是当时精神分析学派的核心成员之一。<br><br>

1908年在奥地利的萨尔茨堡召开的第一次国际心理分析会议期间，阿德勒发表了关于“好斗的冲动”的报告。<br><br>

1910 年任维也纳精神分析学会主席。<br><br>

1911 年因突出强调社会因素的作用，公开反对弗洛伊德的泛性论而两人关系破裂，阿德勒创立个体心理学（individual psychology），另建自由精神分析研究会。<br><br>

1912 年改称个体心理学会，成为一个颇有影响的学派。<br><br>

1914 年他创办《国际个体心理学杂志》。<br><br>

1895 年，阿德勒进入维也纳大学取得医学博士学位，初为一眼科医师，他特别注意身体器官的自卑，认为它是驱使个人采取行动的真正动力。后转向精神病学，曾追随弗洛伊德探讨神经症问题。<br><br>

1920 年后任教于维也纳教育学院，并在学校系统中组织儿童指导临床活动，成立儿童指导中心。<br><br>

1922 年至 1930 年期间，他主持召开了五次国际个体心理学会议。<br><br>

1926 年任美国哥伦比亚大学的客座教授。<br><br>

1932 年他到长岛医学院任美国医学心理学的第一个讲座。<br><br>

1934 年定居纽约。<br><br>

被称为阿德勒门徒( Protégé)的Rudolf Dreikurs在芝加哥（Chicago）成立阿德勒研习会。<br><br>

Rudolf Dreikurs<br><br>

鲁道夫・德雷克斯 Rudolf Dreikurs （1897－1972），美国儿童心理学家、精神病医生和教育家。Dreikurs出生于奥地利维也纳，逝于美国芝加哥。 1918 年开始其医学研究生涯。Dreikurs结识了阿德勒，那时阿德勒已经是一位声誉显赫的精神病学家了，他对德雷克斯产生了极大的影响。1923 年获得维也纳大学医学博士学位后，德雷克斯与阿德勒密切合作研究家庭与儿童咨询，直到阿德勒离开奥地利。<br><br>


Rudolf Dreikurs (1897, Vienna C 1972, Chicago) was an American psychiatrist and educator who developed psychologist Alfred Adler's system of individual psychology into a pragmatic method for understanding the purposes of reprehensible behaviour in children and for stimulating cooperative behaviour without punishment or reward.<br><br>

He suggested that human misbehavior is the result of feeling a lack of belonging to one's social group. When this happens the child acts from one of four "mistaken goals": undue attention, power, revenge or avoidance (inadequacy). His overall goal was that students would learn to cooperate reasonably without being penalized or rewarded because they would feel that they are valuable contributors to the classroom.<br><br>

In 1952, Dreikurs organized a group of followers of Adlerian Psychology to found the North American Society of Adlerian Psychology.<br><br>

Positive Discipline is a program designed to teach young people to become
responsible, respectful and resourceful members of their communities. Based on the
best selling Positive Discipline books by Dr. Jane Nelsen, Lynn Lott, Cheryl Erwin,
Kate Ortolano, Mary Hughes, Mike Brock, Lisa Larson and others, it teaches
important social and life skills in a manner that is deeply respectful and encouraging
for both children and adults (including parents, teachers, childcare providers, youth
workers, and others).<br><br>
Recent research tells us that children are “hardwired” from birth to connect
with others, and that children who feel a sense of connection to their community,
family, and school are less likely to misbehave. To be successful, contributing members
of their community, children must learn necessary social and life skills. Positive
Discipline is based on the understanding that discipline must be taught and that
discipline teaches.<br><br>
Jane Nelsen gives the following criteria for “effective discipline that teaches”:<br><br>
FIVE CRITERIA FOR EFFECTIVE DISCIPLINE<br><br>
Effective discipline…<br><br>
1) Helps children feel a sense of connection. (Belonging and significance)<br><br>
2) Is mutually respectful and encouraging. (Kind and firm at the same time.)<br><br>
3) Is effective long - term. (Considers what the child is thinking, feeling, learning,
and deciding about himself and his world C and what to do in the future to
survive or to thrive.)<br><br>
4) Teaches important social and life skills . (Respect, concern for others, problem
solving, and cooperation as well as the skills to contribute to the home, school or larger
community.)<br><br>
5) Invites children to discover how capable they are. (Encourages the constructive use of
personal power and autonomy.)<br><br>
Ref: <a href= "story09.html">The Five Love Languages</a><br><br>

The Positive Discipline Parenting and Classroom Management models are aimed
at developing mutually respectful relationships. Positive Discipline teaches adults to
employ kindness and firmness at the same time, and is neither punitive nor permissive.
The tools and concepts of Positive Discipline include:<br><br>
-- Mutual respect. Adults model firmness by respecting themselves and the
needs of the situation, and kindness by respecting the needs of the child.<br><br>
-- Identifying the belief behind the behavior. Effective discipline
recognizes the reasons kids do what they do and works to change those beliefs,
rather than merely attempting to change behavior.<br><br>
-- Effective communication and problem solving skills.<br><br>
-- Discipline that teaches (and is neither permissive nor punitive).<br><br>
-- Focusing on solutions instead of punishment.<br><br>
-- Encouragement (instead of praise). Encouragement notices effort and
improvement, not just success, and builds long-term self-esteem and
empowerment..<br><br>
Unique characteristics of the Positive Discipline Model also include:<br><br>
-- Teaching adults and students through experiential activities.<br><br>
Creating opportunity to practice new skills and to have fun learning by doing.<br><br>
-- Classroom discipline programs and parent education programs
that are consistent. Parents, teachers, and childcare providers can work
together to provide a secure, consistent environment for children.<br><br>
-- Inexpensive training and ongoing support so members of communities
can teach each other Positive Discipline skills..<br><br>
-- Certified trainers across the country who can work with schools
and communities.<br><br>

A HISTORY OF POSITIVE DISCIPLINE<br><br>
The Positive Discipline Parenting and Classroom Management Model is based
on the work of Alfred Adler and Rudolf Dreikurs.1 Dr. Adler first introduced the idea
of parenting education to United States audiences in the 1920s. He advocated treating
children respectfully, but also argued that spoiling and pampering children was not
encouraging to them and resulted in social and behavioral problems. The classroom
techniques, which were initially introduced in Vienna in the early 1920s, were brought
to the United States by Dr. Dreikurs in the late 1930s. Dreikurs and Adler refer to the
kind and firm approach to teaching and parenting as “democratic.”<br><br>
In the 1980’s, Lynn Lott and Jane Nelsen attended a workshop facilitated by
John Taylor.2 Lynn began training interns to teach experientially and wrote (with the
help of her interns) the first Teaching Parenting Manual. Jane was the director of
Project ACCEPT (Adlerian Counseling Concepts for Encouraging Parents and
Teachers), a federally funded project that had received exemplary status while in its
developmental phase. Jane wrote and self-published Positive Discipline in 1981. It was
published by Ballantine in 1987. In 1988, Jane and Lynn decided to collaborate on the
book which is now titled, Positive Discipline for Teenagers, and began to teach
parenting and classroom management skills experientially. Lynn and Jane also wrote
Positive Discipline in the Classroom and developed a manual filled with experiential
activities for teachers and their students.<br><br>
In the years since, Positive Discipline series has grown to include titles that
address different age groups, family settings, and special situations. Positive Discipline
is taught to schools, parents, and parent educators by trained Certified Positive
Discipline Associates. Community members, parents, and teachers are encouraged to
become trained facilitators and to share the concepts of Positive Discipline with their
own groups.<br><br>
Positive Discipline parent education classes are taught across the country, and
Positive Discipline is successfully used as the classroom management model in private,
religious, and public elementary schools. A demonstration school program is currently
being developed.<br><br>

THE EVIDENCE FOR POSITIVE DISCIPLINE<br><br>
Formal evaluation comparing Positive Discipline Schools with schools using
other discipline programs is just beginning. However, studies of implementation
of Positive Discipline techniques have shown that Positive Discipline tools do
produce significant results. A study of school-wide implementation of classroom
meetings in a lower-income Sacramento elementary school over a four-year
period showed that suspensions decreased (from 64 annually to 4 annually),
vandalism decreased (from 24 episodes to 2) and teachers reported improvement
in classroom atmosphere, behavior, attitudes and academic performance. (Platt,
1979) A study of parent and teacher education programs directed at parents and
teachers of students with “maladaptive” behavior that implemented Positive
Discipline tools showed a statistically significant improvement in the behavior of
students in the program schools when compared to control schools. (Nelsen,
1979) Smaller studies examining the impacts of specific Positive Discipline tools
have also shown positive results. (Browning, 2000; Potter, 1999; Esquivel) Studies
have repeatedly demonstrated that a student’s perception of being part of the
school community (being “connected” to school) decreases the incidence of
socially risky behavior (such as emotional distress and suicidal thoughts /
attempts, cigarette, alcohol and marijuana use; violent behavior) and increases
academic performance. (Resnick et al, 1997; Battistich, 1999; Goodenow, 1993)
There is also significant evidence that teaching younger students social skills has
a protective effect that lasts into adolescence. Students that have been taught
social skills are more likely to succeed in school and less likely to engage in
problem behaviors. (Kellam et al, 1998; Battistich, 1999)<br><br>
Although specific studies of the Positive Discipline parenting program are
in the early stages, programs similar to Positive Discipline have been studied and
shown to be effective in changing parent behavior. In a study of Adlerian parent
education classes for parents of teens, Stanley (1978) found that parents did
more problem solving with their teens and were less autocratic in decision
making. Positive Discipline teaches parents the skills to be both kind and firm at
the same time. Numerous studies show that teens who perceive their parents as
both kind (responsive) and firm (demanding) are at lower risk for smoking, use of
marijuana, use of alcohol, or being violent, and have a later onset of sexual
activity. (Aquilino, 2001; Baumrind, 1991; Jackson et al, 1998; Simons, Morton
et al, 2001) Other studies have correlated the teen’s perception of parenting style
(kind and firm versus autocratic or permissive) with improved academic
performance. (Cohen, 1997; Deslandes, 1997; Dornbusch et al, 1987; Lam,
1997).<br><br>

What does Hillary stand for?<br><br>
The most familiar candidate is surprisingly unknown<br><br>
Zanny Minton Beddoes, Editor-in-Chief, The Economist<br><br>
共和党坚持自己的理想，死不悔改；<br><br>
民主党谄媚讨好灵活多变，两面三刀。<br><br>
还是赵传，生活的压力与生命的尊严，哪一个重要？？<br><br>
Apr 11th 2015<br><br>
ANY day now, Hillary Clinton is expected to declare that she is running for president. For most Americans this will be as surprising as the news that Cinco de Mayo will once again be on May 5th. Mrs Clinton has had her eye on the top job for a long time. She nearly won it in 2008 and is in many ways a stronger candidate now. She and her husband have built a vast campaign machine. The moment Mrs Clinton turns the key, it will begin openly to suck up contributions, spit out sound bites and roll over her rivals. Some think her unstoppable: Paddy Power, an Irish bookmaker, gives her a 91% chance of capturing the White House in 2016.<br><br>
Steady on. The last time she seemed inevitable, she turned out not to be. The month before the Iowa caucuses in 2008, she was 20 points ahead of other Democrats in national polls, yet she still lost to a young senator from Illinois. She is an unsparkling campaigner, albeit disciplined and diligent. This time, no plausible candidate has yet emerged to compete with her for the Democratic nomination, but there is still time. Primary voters want a choice, not a coronation (see article). And it is hard to say how she would fare against the eventual Republican nominee, not least since nobody has any idea who that will be. The field promises to be varied, ranging from the hyperventilating Ted Cruz to the staid Jeb Bush. Rand Paul, a critic of foreign wars and Barack Obama’s surveillance state, joined the fray on April 7th (see article). Still, Mrs Clinton starts as the favourite, so it is worth asking: what does she stand for?<br><br>

Air miles and briefing books<br><br>

Competence and experience, say her supporters. As secretary of state, she flew nearly a million miles and visited 112 countries. If a foreign crisis occurs on her watch, there is a good chance she will already have been there, read the briefing book and had tea with the local power brokers. No other candidate of either party can boast as much.
<br><br>
She also understands Washington, DC, as well as anyone. For eight years she was a close adviser to a president (her husband) who balanced the budget and secured bipartisan agreements to reform welfare and open up trade in North America. Afterwards, as a senator, Mrs Clinton made a habit of listening to, and working with, senators on both sides of the aisle, leading some Republicans publicly to regret having disliked her in the past. A President Hillary Clinton could be better at hammering out deals with lawmakers (of both parties) than President Obama has been. She would almost certainly try harder.
<br><br>
But to what end? For someone who has been on the national stage for a quarter-century, her beliefs are strangely hard to pin down. On foreign policy, she says she is neither a realist nor an idealist but an “idealistic realist”. In a recent memoir, she celebrates “the American model of free markets for free people”. Yet to a left-wing crowd, she says: “Don’t let anybody tell you, that, you know, it’s corporations and businesses that create jobs.” (An aide later said she meant tax breaks for corporations.) Some candidates’ views can be inferred from the advisers they retain, but Mrs Clinton has hundreds, including luminaries from every Democratic faction. Charles Schumer, her former Senate colleague from New York, called her “the most opaque person you’ll ever meet in your life”.<br><br>
Hillary Clinton lacks Democratic rivals, even though doubts about her linger<br><br>

Mrs Clinton’s critics on the right fret that she is a power-hungry statist. (“Give her an inch and she’ll be your ruler,” warns a campaign badge.) On the left they fear that she is close to Wall Street (her campaign is predicted to raise $1 billion), divorced from the lives of ordinary Americans (she first moved into a governor’s mansion in 1979) and hawkish (she backed the invasion of Iraq). Perhaps she is something in between: a sensible moderate? She fits this bill better than, say, Elizabeth Warren or Martin O’Malley, two possible Democratic rivals who bash trade and banking. But voters need to know more.<br><br>

The last time Mrs Clinton set out a detailed economic plan, during the 2008 campaign, she placed herself a little to the left of her husband in the 1990s (less keen on trade deals, for example) and quite close to where Mr Obama has ended up (indeed, Obamacare resembles her plan more than his). The world has since changed, and Democrats are furiously divided over how to ease inequality without constricting growth (see article). The Centre for American Progress, one of the think-tanks Mrs Clinton listens to, recently released a list of policies to promote what it calls “inclusive capitalism”. This contains lots of sensible stuff, such as boosting investment in infrastructure and expanding wage subsidies for hard-up workers; some intriguing ideas, such as encouraging “works councils” to bring labour and management together; and some dubious ones, such as ramping up implied subsidies for mortgages and creating make-work schemes for the young. How much of this would Mrs Clinton favour? Some details would be nice.<br><br>

On foreign policy, Mrs Clinton’s pitch is that she would be tougher than Mr Obama. She backed his surge of troops in Afghanistan but regretted the expiry date he put on it. She urged him to arm the non-Islamist rebels in Syria; he dithered. She chides him for failing to find a better organising principle for foreign policy than “Don’t do stupid stuff.” Yet she leaves many details unfilled. For example: does she think she could have struck a better nuclear deal with Iran? Nonetheless, many foreigners would welcome an American commander-in-chief who is genuinely engaged with the world outside America.<br><br>
Secrecy and privilege<br><br>

Sceptics raise two further worries about Mrs Clinton. Some say she is untrustworthy―a notion only reinforced by the revelation that she used a private server for her e-mails as secretary of state, released only the ones she deemed relevant and then deleted the rest. The other worry, which she cannot really allay, is that dynasties are unhealthy, and that this outweighs any benefit America might gain from electing its first female president. Gary Hart, a former presidential candidate, told Politico that, with more than 300m people in America, “We should not be down to two families who are qualified to govern.” The campaign has barely begun, but if Mrs Clinton is to deserve the job she desires, she has questions to answer.<br><br>

雍正皇帝十五位兄弟的生死之谜<br><br>

雍正在《大义觉迷录》一书中，就“谋父”、“逼母”、“弑兄”、“屠弟”、“贪财”、“好杀”、“酗酒”、“淫色”、“好谀”、“任佞”等十项大罪，进行自辩，颁行天下。然而，事与愿违，欲盖弥彰，弄巧成拙，愈描愈黑，留下生动而曲折的历史故事。<br><br>

那么事实究竟如何？雍正的上述罪名能否成立？让我们一一分析：<br><br>

雍正是否毒死皇父？一种说法是：康熙帝是喝了胤送的人参汤被毒死的。这话从伦理、法理、情理讲，既悖于情，也不合理。从当时的具体环境、周围条件分析，既违背史实，也绝无可能。<br><br>

雍正是否逼死生母？《大义觉迷录》说：“逆书加朕以逼母之名。”看来当时雍正“逼母”说流传很广。雍正生母乌雅氏，生有三个儿子：胤、允祚(5岁死)、允祯。传说：雍正继位后，将允祯调回北京关押起来，他母亲想见允祯，雍正不准。太后一气之下，撞死在铁柱子上。乌雅氏眼看亲生儿子允祯被囚禁，作为皇太后能不生气吗？时人将雍正母亲的死同雍正囚禁胞弟联系起来是很自然的事情。
<br><br>
雍正是否弑兄杀弟？雍正继承皇位之日，就面临着兄弟们的不满和挑战。康熙崩逝的噩耗传出，京城九门关闭6天，诸王非得令旨不得进入大内。箭在弦上，形势紧张。当时年满20岁的皇子共有15人：即雍正的大哥允、二哥允、三哥允祉、五弟允祺、七弟允、八弟允、九弟允、十弟允、十二弟允、十三弟允祥、十四弟允祯、十五弟允、十六弟允禄和十七弟允礼。<br><br>


大阿哥允A，在太子废立中得罪皇父，被夺封爵，幽于府第。康熙派贝勒延寿等轮番监守，并严谕：疏忽者，当族诛。允已成为一只不见天日的死老虎。雍正十二年(1734年)死，以贝子礼殡葬。<br><br>

二阿哥即废太子允i，被禁锢在咸安宫。雍正仍不放心，一方面封其为理郡王，另一方面又命在山西祁县郑家庄盖房驻兵，将允移居幽禁。雍正二年(1724年)，允死去。
<br><br>
三阿哥允祉，本不太热心皇储，一门心思编书，但也受到牵连。雍正即位后，以“允祉与太子素亲睦”为由，命“允祉守护景陵”，发配到遵化为康熙守陵。允祉心里不高兴，免不了私下发些牢骚。雍正知道后，干脆将允祉夺爵，幽禁于景山永安亭。雍正十年(1732年)，允祉死。
<br><br>
五弟允祺，康熙亲征噶尔丹时，曾领正黄旗大营，后被封为恒亲王。允祺没有结党，也没有争储。雍正即位后，借故削其子的封爵。雍正十年(1732年)，允祺死。<br><br>

六弟允祚，康熙十九年（1680年）生。母孝恭仁皇后。康熙二十四年夭折。<br><br>

七弟允佑，康熙十九年（1680年）生。母成妃戴佳氏。康熙夸他：“心好，举止和蔼可亲。”康熙亲征葛尔丹时，命允佑领镶黄旗大营。18岁，被封为贝勒；29岁，晋淳郡王。八年，卒。<br><br>
八弟允T，是雍正兄弟中最为优秀、最有才能的一位。但是，“皇太子之废也，允谋继立，世宗深憾之”。雍正继位后，视允及其党羽为眼中钉、肉中刺。允心里也明白，常怏怏不快。雍正继位，耍了个两面派手法：先封允为亲王―其福晋对来祝贺者说：“何贺为？虑不免首领耳！”这话传到雍正那里，命将允福晋赶回娘家。不久，借故命允在太庙前跪一昼夜。后命削允王爵，高墙圈禁，改其名为“阿其那”。“阿其那”一词，学者解释有所不同，过去多认为是“猪”的意思，近来有学者解释为“不要脸”。允幽禁多年，受尽折磨，终被害死。<br><br>

九弟允K，因同允结党，也为雍正所不容。允心里明白，私下表示：“我行将出家离世。”雍正哪能容许允出家！他借故将允革去黄带子、削宗籍，逮捕囚禁。改允名为“塞思黑”。“塞思黑”一词，过去多认为是“狗”的意思，近来有学者亦解释为“不要脸”。不久又给允定28条罪状，送往保定，加以械锁，命直隶总督李绂幽禁之。允在保定狱所备受折磨，以“腹疾卒于幽所”，传说是被毒死的。<br><br>

十弟允（礻我），因党附允T，为雍正所恨。雍正元年(1723年)，哲布尊丹巴胡图克图来京病故，送灵龛还喀尔喀(今蒙古国)，命允印册赐奠。允称有病不能行，命居住在张家口。同年借故将其夺爵，逮回京师拘禁。直到乾隆二年(1737年)才开释，后死。<br><br>

十一弟胤，康熙二十四年生,母宜妃郭络罗氏,康熙三十五年夭折。<br><br>

十二弟允，康熙末年任镶黄旗满洲都统，很受重用，也很有权，但没有结党谋位。雍正刚即位，封允为履郡王。不久，借故将其降为“在固山贝子上行走”，就是从郡王降为比贝勒还低的贝子，且不给实爵，仅享受贝子待遇。不久，又将其降为镇国公。乾隆即位后被晋封为履亲王。这位允较之其他兄弟气量大，一直活到乾隆二十八年(1763年)，享年78岁。<br><br>

十三弟允祥，康熙二十五年（1686年）生。母敬敏皇贵妃章佳氏。康熙六十一年，雍正即位，封为怡亲王，命总理户部三库。雍正元年，总理户部。为人“敬谨廉洁”，雍正照例赐钱粮、官物，均辞而不受；对雍正“克尽臣弟之道”，总理事务“谨慎忠诚”，为雍正所赏识。三年，从优议叙，复加封郡王，任王于诸子中指封。后总理京畿水利，多有建树。又办理西北两路军机。八年，死。是雍正最知心、得其协助最多的兄弟。<br><br>

十四弟允_，虽与雍正一母同胞，但因他党同允，又传闻康熙临终前命传位“胤祯”而雍正之党篡改为“胤”，所以二人成了不共戴天的冤家兄弟。雍正即位，先是不许抚远大将军允祯进城吊丧，又命其在遵化看守皇父的景陵，再将其父子禁锢于景山寿皇殿。乾隆继位后，将其开释。<br><br>

十五弟允偶，康熙死后，雍正命其守景陵。<br><br>
