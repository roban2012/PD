	What is Positive Discipline?
	</font>	
	</center>

	<font size=5>
	<br><br>


Positive Discipline is a program designed to teach young people to become
responsible, respectful and resourceful members of their communities. Based on the
best selling Positive Discipline books by Dr. Jane Nelsen, Lynn Lott, Cheryl Erwin,
Kate Ortolano, Mary Hughes, Mike Brock, Lisa Larson and others, it teaches
important social and life skills in a manner that is deeply respectful and encouraging
for both children and adults (including parents, teachers, childcare providers, youth
workers, and others).<br><br>
Recent research tells us that children are “hardwired” from birth to connect
with others, and that children who feel a sense of connection to their community,
family, and school are less likely to misbehave. To be successful, contributing members
of their community, children must learn necessary social and life skills. Positive
Discipline is based on the understanding that discipline must be taught and that
discipline teaches.<br><br>
Jane Nelsen gives the following criteria for “effective discipline that teaches”:<br><br>
FIVE CRITERIA FOR EFFECTIVE DISCIPLINE<br><br>
Effective discipline…<br><br>
1) Helps children feel a sense of connection. (Belonging and significance)<br><br>
2) Is mutually respectful and encouraging. (Kind and firm at the same time.)<br><br>
3) Is effective long - term. (Considers what the child is thinking, feeling, learning,
and deciding about himself and his world C and what to do in the future to
survive or to thrive.)<br><br>
4) Teaches important social and life skills . (Respect, concern for others, problem
solving, and cooperation as well as the skills to contribute to the home, school or larger
community.)<br><br>
5) Invites children to discover how capable they are. (Encourages the constructive use of
personal power and autonomy.)<br><br>

The Positive Discipline Parenting and Classroom Management models are aimed
at developing mutually respectful relationships. Positive Discipline teaches adults to
employ kindness and firmness at the same time, and is neither punitive nor permissive.
The tools and concepts of Positive Discipline include:<br><br>
-- Mutual respect. Adults model firmness by respecting themselves and the
needs of the situation, and kindness by respecting the needs of the child.<br><br>
-- Identifying the belief behind the behavior. Effective discipline
recognizes the reasons kids do what they do and works to change those beliefs,
rather than merely attempting to change behavior.<br><br>
-- Effective communication and problem solving skills.<br><br>
-- Discipline that teaches (and is neither permissive nor punitive).<br><br>
-- Focusing on solutions instead of punishment.<br><br>
-- Encouragement (instead of praise). Encouragement notices effort and
improvement, not just success, and builds long-term self-esteem and
empowerment..<br><br>
Unique characteristics of the Positive Discipline Model also include:<br><br>
-- Teaching adults and students through experiential activities.<br><br>
Creating opportunity to practice new skills and to have fun learning by doing.<br><br>
-- Classroom discipline programs and parent education programs
that are consistent. Parents, teachers, and childcare providers can work
together to provide a secure, consistent environment for children.<br><br>
-- Inexpensive training and ongoing support so members of communities
can teach each other Positive Discipline skills..<br><br>
-- Certified trainers across the country who can work with schools
and communities.<br><br>

A HISTORY OF POSITIVE DISCIPLINE<br><br>
The Positive Discipline Parenting and Classroom Management Model is based
on the work of Alfred Adler and Rudolf Dreikurs.1 Dr. Adler first introduced the idea
of parenting education to United States audiences in the 1920s. He advocated treating
children respectfully, but also argued that spoiling and pampering children was not
encouraging to them and resulted in social and behavioral problems. The classroom
techniques, which were initially introduced in Vienna in the early 1920s, were brought
to the United States by Dr. Dreikurs in the late 1930s. Dreikurs and Adler refer to the
kind and firm approach to teaching and parenting as “democratic.”<br><br>
In the 1980’s, Lynn Lott and Jane Nelsen attended a workshop facilitated by
John Taylor.2 Lynn began training interns to teach experientially and wrote (with the
help of her interns) the first Teaching Parenting Manual. Jane was the director of
Project ACCEPT (Adlerian Counseling Concepts for Encouraging Parents and
Teachers), a federally funded project that had received exemplary status while in its
developmental phase. Jane wrote and self-published Positive Discipline in 1981. It was
published by Ballantine in 1987. In 1988, Jane and Lynn decided to collaborate on the
book which is now titled, Positive Discipline for Teenagers, and began to teach
parenting and classroom management skills experientially. Lynn and Jane also wrote
Positive Discipline in the Classroom and developed a manual filled with experiential
activities for teachers and their students.<br><br>
In the years since, Positive Discipline series has grown to include titles that
address different age groups, family settings, and special situations. Positive Discipline
is taught to schools, parents, and parent educators by trained Certified Positive
Discipline Associates. Community members, parents, and teachers are encouraged to
become trained facilitators and to share the concepts of Positive Discipline with their
own groups.<br><br>
Positive Discipline parent education classes are taught across the country, and
Positive Discipline is successfully used as the classroom management model in private,
religious, and public elementary schools. A demonstration school program is currently
being developed.<br><br>

THE EVIDENCE FOR POSITIVE DISCIPLINE<br><br>
Formal evaluation comparing Positive Discipline Schools with schools using
other discipline programs is just beginning. However, studies of implementation
of Positive Discipline techniques have shown that Positive Discipline tools do
produce significant results. A study of school-wide implementation of classroom
meetings in a lower-income Sacramento elementary school over a four-year
period showed that suspensions decreased (from 64 annually to 4 annually),
vandalism decreased (from 24 episodes to 2) and teachers reported improvement
in classroom atmosphere, behavior, attitudes and academic performance. (Platt,
1979) A study of parent and teacher education programs directed at parents and
teachers of students with “maladaptive” behavior that implemented Positive
Discipline tools showed a statistically significant improvement in the behavior of
students in the program schools when compared to control schools. (Nelsen,
1979) Smaller studies examining the impacts of specific Positive Discipline tools
have also shown positive results. (Browning, 2000; Potter, 1999; Esquivel) Studies
have repeatedly demonstrated that a student’s perception of being part of the
school community (being “connected” to school) decreases the incidence of
socially risky behavior (such as emotional distress and suicidal thoughts /
attempts, cigarette, alcohol and marijuana use; violent behavior) and increases
academic performance. (Resnick et al, 1997; Battistich, 1999; Goodenow, 1993)
There is also significant evidence that teaching younger students social skills has
a protective effect that lasts into adolescence. Students that have been taught
social skills are more likely to succeed in school and less likely to engage in
problem behaviors. (Kellam et al, 1998; Battistich, 1999)<br><br>
Although specific studies of the Positive Discipline parenting program are
in the early stages, programs similar to Positive Discipline have been studied and
shown to be effective in changing parent behavior. In a study of Adlerian parent
education classes for parents of teens, Stanley (1978) found that parents did
more problem solving with their teens and were less autocratic in decision
making. Positive Discipline teaches parents the skills to be both kind and firm at
the same time. Numerous studies show that teens who perceive their parents as
both kind (responsive) and firm (demanding) are at lower risk for smoking, use of
marijuana, use of alcohol, or being violent, and have a later onset of sexual
activity. (Aquilino, 2001; Baumrind, 1991; Jackson et al, 1998; Simons, Morton
et al, 2001) Other studies have correlated the teen’s perception of parenting style
(kind and firm versus autocratic or permissive) with improved academic
performance. (Cohen, 1997; Deslandes, 1997; Dornbusch et al, 1987; Lam,
1997).<br><br>

What does Hillary stand for?<br><br>
The most familiar candidate is surprisingly unknown<br><br>

还是赵传，生活的压力与生命的尊严，哪一个重要？？<br><br>
Apr 11th 2015<br><br>
ANY day now, Hillary Clinton is expected to declare that she is running for president. For most Americans this will be as surprising as the news that Cinco de Mayo will once again be on May 5th. Mrs Clinton has had her eye on the top job for a long time. She nearly won it in 2008 and is in many ways a stronger candidate now. She and her husband have built a vast campaign machine. The moment Mrs Clinton turns the key, it will begin openly to suck up contributions, spit out sound bites and roll over her rivals. Some think her unstoppable: Paddy Power, an Irish bookmaker, gives her a 91% chance of capturing the White House in 2016.<br><br>
Steady on. The last time she seemed inevitable, she turned out not to be. The month before the Iowa caucuses in 2008, she was 20 points ahead of other Democrats in national polls, yet she still lost to a young senator from Illinois. She is an unsparkling campaigner, albeit disciplined and diligent. This time, no plausible candidate has yet emerged to compete with her for the Democratic nomination, but there is still time. Primary voters want a choice, not a coronation (see article). And it is hard to say how she would fare against the eventual Republican nominee, not least since nobody has any idea who that will be. The field promises to be varied, ranging from the hyperventilating Ted Cruz to the staid Jeb Bush. Rand Paul, a critic of foreign wars and Barack Obama’s surveillance state, joined the fray on April 7th (see article). Still, Mrs Clinton starts as the favourite, so it is worth asking: what does she stand for?<br><br>

Air miles and briefing books<br><br>

Competence and experience, say her supporters. As secretary of state, she flew nearly a million miles and visited 112 countries. If a foreign crisis occurs on her watch, there is a good chance she will already have been there, read the briefing book and had tea with the local power brokers. No other candidate of either party can boast as much.
<br><br>
She also understands Washington, DC, as well as anyone. For eight years she was a close adviser to a president (her husband) who balanced the budget and secured bipartisan agreements to reform welfare and open up trade in North America. Afterwards, as a senator, Mrs Clinton made a habit of listening to, and working with, senators on both sides of the aisle, leading some Republicans publicly to regret having disliked her in the past. A President Hillary Clinton could be better at hammering out deals with lawmakers (of both parties) than President Obama has been. She would almost certainly try harder.
<br><br>
But to what end? For someone who has been on the national stage for a quarter-century, her beliefs are strangely hard to pin down. On foreign policy, she says she is neither a realist nor an idealist but an “idealistic realist”. In a recent memoir, she celebrates “the American model of free markets for free people”. Yet to a left-wing crowd, she says: “Don’t let anybody tell you, that, you know, it’s corporations and businesses that create jobs.” (An aide later said she meant tax breaks for corporations.) Some candidates’ views can be inferred from the advisers they retain, but Mrs Clinton has hundreds, including luminaries from every Democratic faction. Charles Schumer, her former Senate colleague from New York, called her “the most opaque person you’ll ever meet in your life”.<br><br>
Hillary Clinton lacks Democratic rivals, even though doubts about her linger<br><br>

Mrs Clinton’s critics on the right fret that she is a power-hungry statist. (“Give her an inch and she’ll be your ruler,” warns a campaign badge.) On the left they fear that she is close to Wall Street (her campaign is predicted to raise $1 billion), divorced from the lives of ordinary Americans (she first moved into a governor’s mansion in 1979) and hawkish (she backed the invasion of Iraq). Perhaps she is something in between: a sensible moderate? She fits this bill better than, say, Elizabeth Warren or Martin O’Malley, two possible Democratic rivals who bash trade and banking. But voters need to know more.<br><br>

The last time Mrs Clinton set out a detailed economic plan, during the 2008 campaign, she placed herself a little to the left of her husband in the 1990s (less keen on trade deals, for example) and quite close to where Mr Obama has ended up (indeed, Obamacare resembles her plan more than his). The world has since changed, and Democrats are furiously divided over how to ease inequality without constricting growth (see article). The Centre for American Progress, one of the think-tanks Mrs Clinton listens to, recently released a list of policies to promote what it calls “inclusive capitalism”. This contains lots of sensible stuff, such as boosting investment in infrastructure and expanding wage subsidies for hard-up workers; some intriguing ideas, such as encouraging “works councils” to bring labour and management together; and some dubious ones, such as ramping up implied subsidies for mortgages and creating make-work schemes for the young. How much of this would Mrs Clinton favour? Some details would be nice.<br><br>

On foreign policy, Mrs Clinton’s pitch is that she would be tougher than Mr Obama. She backed his surge of troops in Afghanistan but regretted the expiry date he put on it. She urged him to arm the non-Islamist rebels in Syria; he dithered. She chides him for failing to find a better organising principle for foreign policy than “Don’t do stupid stuff.” Yet she leaves many details unfilled. For example: does she think she could have struck a better nuclear deal with Iran? Nonetheless, many foreigners would welcome an American commander-in-chief who is genuinely engaged with the world outside America.<br><br>
Secrecy and privilege<br><br>

Sceptics raise two further worries about Mrs Clinton. Some say she is untrustworthy―a notion only reinforced by the revelation that she used a private server for her e-mails as secretary of state, released only the ones she deemed relevant and then deleted the rest. The other worry, which she cannot really allay, is that dynasties are unhealthy, and that this outweighs any benefit America might gain from electing its first female president. Gary Hart, a former presidential candidate, told Politico that, with more than 300m people in America, “We should not be down to two families who are qualified to govern.” The campaign has barely begun, but if Mrs Clinton is to deserve the job she desires, she has questions to answer.<br><br>
