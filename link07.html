- In order to be effective communicators of love, we must be willing to learn our spouse’s
primary love language.<br><br>
- The “in-love” experience does not focus on our own growth or on the growth and
development of the other person. Rather, it gives us the sense that we have arrived and
we do not need further growth.<br><br>
- The “in-love” experience is a temporary high and then you proceed to “real love” which
is emotional in nature, not obsessive.<br><br>
- Real love requires effort, discipline and daily attention and is a choice because feelings
ebb and flow.<br><br>
	
Love Language #1: <br><br>Words of Affirmation<br><br>
-- Giving verbal compliments and encouraging statements<br><br>
-- The object of love is not getting something you want, but doing something for
the well-being of the one you love. It is a fact however, that when we receive
affirming words, we are far more likely to be motivated to reciprocate and do
something our spouse desires<br><br>
-- Must learn what is important to your spouse<br><br>
-- If we are to communicate love verbally, we must use kind words<br><br>
-- No double messages, i.e., tone of voice is incongruent with words<br><br>
-- Make requests instead of demands<br><br>
-- Focal point is what we are saying to our spouse<br><br>
Love Language #2: <br><br>Quality Time<br><br>
-- Giving someone your undivided attention: A central aspect of quality time is
togetherness…togetherness has to do with focused attention<br><br>
-- The shared activity is a vehicle that creates a sense of togetherness<br><br>
-- Quality conversation―sympathetic dialogue where two individuals are
sharing their experiences, thoughts, feelings, and desires in a friendly and
uninterrupted context<br><br>
-- Quality activities may include anything in which one or both of you have an
interest. One of the byproducts of quality activities is that they provide a
memory bank from which to draw in the years ahead.<br><br>

Love Language #3: <br><br>Receiving Gifts<br><br>
-- A gift is something you can hold in your hand and say “Look, he/she was
thinking of me” or “He/she remembered me.”<br><br>
-- A gift itself is a symbol of thought. It does not matter if it costs money.
-- Gifts are visual symbols of love. Remember, visual symbols of love are more
important to some people than others.<br><br>
-- By making/purchasing gifts, you are investing in your relationship and filling
your spouse’s “emotional love tank” and when the tank is full, he/she will
likely reciprocate emotional love to you in a language you will understand
-- Physical presence in the time of crisis is the most powerful gift you can give if
your spouse’s primary love language is receiving gifts.<br><br>
Love Language #4: Acts of Service<br><br>
-- Doing things your spouse would like you to do, i.e., cooking a meal, cleaning,
walking the dog<br><br>
-- These acts of service require thought, planning, time, effort and energy. If
they are done with a positive spirit, they are indeed expressions of love<br><br>
-- Requests give direction to the love but demands stop the flow of love<br><br>
-- What we do for each other before marriage is no indication of what we will
do after marriage<br><br>
-- When we treat our spouses as objects, we preclude the possibility of love<br><br>
Love Language #5: <br><br>Physical Touch<br><br>
-- Physical touch is a powerful communicator of love―for some it is their
primary love language and without it, they feel unloved<br><br>
-- Sexual intercourse…is only one dialect in the love language of physical touch.
There are tiny tactile receptors located throughout the body. When those
receptors are touched or pressed, nerves carry impulses to the brain. We
perceive the thing that touched us is warm or cold, loving or hostile<br><br>
-- Learn to speak your spouse’s dialect―your spouse may find some touches
irritating or uncomfortable<br><br>
-- Guys―If your spouse’s primary love language is physical touch, nothing is
more important than holding her as she cries<br><br>


Discovering Your Primary Language<br><br>
- If your primary language does not jump out to you, you can consider the negative
use of love languages:<br><br>
- What does your spouse say or do or fail to say or do that hurts you deeply?<br><br>
- What do you criticize your partner for not doing in your relationship?<br><br>
Things to do if Your Partner’s Primary Love Language Is…<br><br>
1. Words of Affirmation:<br><br>
a. For one week, keep a written record of all the words of affirmation you
give your spouse and review your record at the end of the week with
him/her<br><br>
b. Write a love letter/poem to your partner<br><br>
c. Compliment your partner in front of his/her parents or friends<br><br>
2. Quality Time:<br><br>
a. Ask your partner for a list of five activities that he/she would enjoy doing.
Make plans to do one of them each month for the next five months<br><br>
b. Think of an activity your partner enjoys, but brings less pleasure to you
and join them in that activity<br><br>
c. Make time every day to share with each other some of the events of the
day<br><br>
3. Receiving Gifts:<br><br>
a. Next time you take a walk together or go out together, pay close attention
to those items that catch his/her attention (clothing, music, leaves on a tree,
etc.) and find a way over the next few weeks to give him/her one of those
items<br><br>
b. Make a personal gift for your spouse<br><br>
c. Give your spouse a gift everyday for a week<br><br>
4. Acts of Service:<br><br>
a. Make a list of all the requests your partner has made of you over the past
couple of weeks. Select one of these each week and do it as an expression
of love<br><br>
b. Ask your partner, “If you have one special request of service for me this
week, what would you request?” Then follow through by doing it (if
possible)<br><br>
c. Ask what daily acts of service would speak love (cooking a meal, taking
out the trash, cleaning out his/her car, etc.) and fit them into your schedule<br><br>
5. Physical Touch:<br><br>
a. Hold your spouse’s hand as you walk places<br><br>
b. Give him/her a hug for no reason at all<br><br>
c. Give him/her a should massage or a back rub or just run your fingers
through his/her hair<br><br>
